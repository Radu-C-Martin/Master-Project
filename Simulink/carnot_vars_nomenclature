Model Parameters
================

Side Windows
------------
windows_size            - [height width] of the large side-windows
window_roof_size        - [height width] of the roof windows (approximated as                                            one large window as opposed to 
                                            the four smaller windows in 
                                            reality)
surface_part            - ???
U                       - heat transfer coefficient [W/m2K] (of the window?)
g                       - total solar energy transmittance
v_g = 0.65              - transmittance in visible range of the sunlight


Roof
----
wall_size               - [length width] of the roof (considered flat)
roof_position           - position angles of the roof


Roof structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The roof is supposed to be made of
    - 5cm wood
    - 10cm insulation
    - 5cm wood
